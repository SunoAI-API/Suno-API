### Unofficial API

This is an unofficial API based on Python and FastAPI. It currently supports generating songs, lyrics, etc.  
It comes with a built-in token maintenance and keep-alive feature, so you don't have to worry about the token expiring.

### Features

- Automatic token maintenance and keep-alive
- Fully asynchronous, fast, suitable for later expansion
- Simple code, easy to maintain, convenient for secondary development

### Usage

#### Configuration

Edit the `.env.example` file, rename to `.env` and fill in the session_id and cookie.

These are initially obtained from the browser, and will be automatically kept alive later.
